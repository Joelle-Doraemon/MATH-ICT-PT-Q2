<h3> We are Paulina Beatrice C. Catilo and Joel Dre B. Santos here to present our website in our integrated performance task for ICT and MATHEMATICS </h3>
<hr> 
<br>
<h1> We will discuss Relations and Functions, Independent and Dependent Variables, Domain and Range, and Graph of Linear Functions, just continue scrolling to view the lessons </h1> <br>
<h1> FIRST TOPIC RELATIONS, FUNCTIONS, INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VARIABLES </h1> <br>
<h1> <b> Relations, Functions, Independent and Dependent Variables </b> </h1> <br>
<h2> GOOD DAY, my name is Joel Dre B. Santos and i present to you, Relations, Functions, Dependent and Independent Variables. <br> <br>
➢ illustrates a relation and a function.
M8AL-IIc-1 <br>

➢ verifies if a given relation is a function.
M8AL-IIc-2 <br>

➢ determines dependent and independent variables.
M8AL-IIc-3 <br>
Math is usually hard for me, but this topic got me at ease, it's very simple and easy to understand, I'll be providing pictures, examples, and analogies along the way </h2> 
<br><h2> A relation is any set of ordered pairs. The set
of all x-values is called the domain of the
relation. The set of all y-values is called the
range of the relation. </h2> <br>

<h2> A function is a special type of relation
which describes that there should be
only one output for each input or every
x-value should be associated with only
one y-value. </h2> <br>

<h2> Basically if there are 2 or more points that hit each other when you draw a line upwards, then it's not a function </h2> <br>

<h2> The Independent variable can be called the "cause" because it is what defines the Dependent variable, the "effect" </h2> <br>

 <h1> I hope that this webpage made everything in math easier and it was a pleasure to discuss this </h1><br>
<h1> SECOND TOPIC, DOMAIN AND RANGE PRESENTED BY PAULINA BEATRICE C. CATILO </h1><br>
<h1>
domain- set of all x values <br>
range- set of all y values <br>
one to one-one element is mapped to one element <br>
many to one-two elements from the domain are mapped to one range. <br>
one to many-one domain is mapped to multiple elements of the range. <br>

<h1> Quite simple right?, let's hop in on a more challenging topic then, TOPIC 3, GRAPH OF LINEAR FUNCTION </h1>
<br>
<hr> 
<p> <h1> It is a line whose expression or formula is given by; y = f(x) = px + q or f(x)=mx+b. It has one independent and one dependent variable. The independent variable is x and the dependent one is y. P is the constant term or the y-intercept and is also the value of the dependent variable. </h1><p>
<br><p><h1>Here are some examples</h1></br>
